# Selenium-JAVA-TestNG-TDD-Framework
Welcome to the Selenium-JAVA-TestNG-TDD-Framework !

Hello Dear Peers / contributors,

Welcome to my page. This project is created with one of the latest tools such as Selenium, TestNG, log4J , Maven, JAVA with TDD approach . You can think this is a kind of very basic skeleton for selenium framework which would be helpful for Novice users who does not have skills to design automation framework. I know it is not so easy to design and integrate different tools together in one frameowrk . However, i tried to making this easy as much as possible. More details are in below.

Lets get into a few details of this sample project . It has been implemented with Selenium 3.4.0 and Unit test framework "Test NG" . Also it is completely mavenized which eventually ensure all dependencies and plugin will be installed in your local as soon as you clone this project if you want to have enhance or reviewed it in your local computer.  By the way , also it has been developed in JAVA language . You may enjoy this project which has all rich usage of OOPS techniques such as Inheritance , encapsulation and polymorphism ..etc .

Moreover , it has designed with one of the very popular and latest design patterns "Page Object Model " with "Page factory" which brings out a flavor of well readability , re-usability and easy maintenance as if it goes for continuous development and integration down the line.

And also this will explain that how to remove your all static data in your test files and keep into one file which is  ".properties file" which should work as central object repository for all your test data and makes easy to update/ modify your data with any future changes at one place rather than in multiple files . Last, but not least. Logs been implemented across the project with Apache "log4j" which will give good trouble shooting of your problem when it fails . Hope you got some high glance and learnt about this work .

Thank you for visiting this page . Good Luck and Happy Coding :)
